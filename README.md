Code for reproducing phylogenetic sensitivity analyses from "A deeper meaning for shallow-level phylogenomic studies: nested anchored hybrid enrichment offers great promise for resolving the tiger moth tree of life (Lepidoptera: Erebidae: Arctiinae)" (https://doi.org/10.1111/syen.12433).

This analysis assesses the impact of locus sampling and site rate variation on phylogenetic trees. Subsampling the data allowed us to test the effect of per site evolutionary rate and gene tree heterogeneity on species tree support. This procedure tests the robustness of the relationships generated, but also examines the ability of the loci to return congruent results when altered to include slower or faster sites.
